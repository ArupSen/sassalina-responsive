<h4>BESPOKE</h4>
<p>Every client's requirements are unique and my job is to make your dream come true….with some expert advice to avoid some of the pitfalls. I believe designing the perfect piece is often a blend of connecting with the emotional reasons for a commission whilst taking into account the physical features of the wearer and practical elements of how the piece will be worn.</p>
<p>
After considering your budget, I will choose a selection of stones for you to peruse. The gem may be rare one of a kind, or you may have several stones to select from.  We then spend as long as you need considering different designs in order to make the dream a reality.</p>
<p>Incredible quality white and coloured diamonds and rare and untreated coloured gemstones have also been sourced from abroad for specialist collectors. Gemmological Lab certificates supplied if required. I can also make high end gem bead necklaces to order, stringing and jewellery repair is also available.</p>

<h4>REDESIGN</h4>
<p>Very often I find myself listening to a friend or colleague talking about inheriting a piece of jewellery that they would never wear.  For me, this is the perfect chance to show how something fabulous can be created in a wearable style unique to the client.</p>
<p>Remodelling jewellery is typically very affordable as you are starting with the basis for the piece.  I have included on this page a few client testimonials with completely different starting points, all of whom are the delighted recipients of new pieces using old stones. I can also help with repairing well-loved jewellery.

<h4>READ PHILIPPA’S TESTIMONIAL HERE</h4>
<div class="show-hide">
<p>"When an elderly aunt died a couple of years ago, leaving me a turquoise and gold brooch in her will, I have to admit that I was quite excited to see what it looked like.  Sadly, the brooch was quite ugly; a dome of tiny turquoise beads surrounded by two elaborate snakes with gold tassels hanging from either side. Knowing that I was never going to wear it, I took it to Sarah to see what she thought.  Straight away, Sarah could see that without its gold surround, the dome of turquoise beads could look well as a pendant on a fine gold chain. The end result is a unique and very pretty necklace.  I wear it often and whenever I do, it attracts compliments. I’m so happy to be able to wear something that belonged to my aunt and I don’t think she would have minded at all that the brooch has been adapted to suit the tastes of a different generation."
