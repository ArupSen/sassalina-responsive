  'francesca'=>array('Francesca G.','"When I met with Sarah I had a clear idea of what I wanted to commission, a pair of earrings that could  be worn everyday and to be made from pale/white stones. However I did not want to use pearls or diamonds, as I really wanted them to be organic and unusual in design. 
  
  Sarah suggested using some semi precious gems that I had never heard of, very unusual and exactly what I wanted. She also held my hand throughout the design process ensuring I was happy with every detail.  I am delighted with the result and use the earrings even more than I expected!"

 'valerie'=> array('Valerie P.','"I contacted Sarah when I wanted to replace my Tiffany diamond tennis bracelet which I had lost. Sarah did a great job and created the most gorgeous diamond tennis bracelet, far superior to the one I lost. I ended up with a bracelet with double the weight in diamonds for the same price. I would highly recommend using the bespoke service Sassalina can offer. Not only do you get exactly what you want, without compromise, you also know you can access top quality stones at a very competitive price."'),
  'sally'=>array('Sally N.','"I have bought several pieces of jewellery from Sarah and have been delighted with them all. Sarah has plenty of jewellery books to look at for inspiration and visits you in the convenience of your own home. She has beautiful stones to choose from and lots of ideas and experience to help you create the perfect piece of jewellery for you. If you are looking for something similar to a piece you have seen in a Bond Street shop, she can make something as beautiful for less money or if you are looking for an entirely unique piece, Sarah can create a one-off. Sarah has also adapted a ring I inherited into a more modern and wearable piece of jewellery."'),
  'sandra'=>array('Sandra R.','"My husband very kindly gave me a lovely princess cut solitaire ring on the birth of my son. I enjoyed wearing it for several years and then I realised I really wanted a more sparkly, fun ring to wear out in the evenings and to special occasions. Sarah helped me select a simple design with a number of princess cut diamonds added to the band and it made the ring instantly more noticeable and glittery. I love the fact that my ring has a new look, but that the main diamond has real sentimental meaning and it was much cheaper than buying a whole new ring!"'),
  'philippa'=>array('Philippa G.','"When an elderly aunt died a couple of years ago, leaving me a turquoise and gold brooch in her will, I have to admit that I was quite excited to see what it looked like.  Sadly, the brooch was quite ugly; a dome of tiny turquoise beads surrounded by two elaborate snakes with gold tassels hanging from either side. 
  Knowing that I was never going to wear it, I took it to Sarah to see what she thought.  Straight away, Sarah could see that without its gold surround, the dome of turquoise beads could look well as a pendant on a fine gold chain. The end result is a unique and very pretty necklace.  I wear it often and whenever I do, it attracts compliments. 
  I’m so happy to be able to wear something that belonged to my aunt and I don’t think she would have minded at all that the brooch has been adapted to suit the tastes of a different generation."

  'cathy'=>array('Cathy J.','"I had a diamond ring that I inherited from my grandmother.  It was a beautiful ring, but the gold was very worn and the claws that held the main diamond were broken making it unsafe to wear.  I spoke to Sarah about resetting it and she persuaded me that I would use it far more if it was made into a necklace.  I am so pleased with the result and wear it every day.  I feel that my grandmother would be really delighted that I am actually wearing the diamond that she left me rather than letting it gather dust at the back of my jewellery box."'),

'"In the 1850\'s, my great great grandfather travelled to South America as a mining engineer where he was paid not in cash, but in gemstones. Few stones have survived but I received a ring which found the emerald set between two clusters of three beautiful diamonds.  Although lovely and of sentimental value, it was a piece that languished in the safe as it was in an old-fashioned setting. I also owned another ring which I was unhappy wearing.  Sarah looked at both rings and discussed a number of ideas with me, based upon what I had said I wanted. Sarah then came up with new designs for a pair of diamond earrings from the stones either side of the emerald, and a ring using the emerald and some diamonds from the other ring. I now have two beautiful pieces that have breathed new life into these gems, which I can now wear often, whilst remaining in touch with my heritage."')
