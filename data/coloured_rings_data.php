  array('Aquamarine and Diamond Ring','Who does not love self gifting and this was a well deserved graduation present! An amazing 17.43ct Aquamarine set in a very simple style using 32 diamonds to accent the Platinum band.'),
  array('Ruby and Diamond Cocktail Ring','My client received a Ruby for her 40th birthday…her daughter\'s name…  We designed a gorgeous cocktail ring using 60pts of pave set diamonds in two tiers with mille grain and yellow gold to highlight the gorgeous central stone.'),
  array('Green Tourmaline and Diamond Ring','Having a passionate love of emeralds and cocktail rings, my client was completely wowed by this amazing blue/green 6.92ct emerald cut Tourmaline. Setting it in 18ct white gold with two tapered baguette Diamonds created a really sophisticated ring.'),
  array('Spinel and Diamond Ring','Spinels are fantastic stones and this one is such a unique purple colour. During its time in my home it had many admirers and there are several who mourn the lost opportunity to own it! However, the good news is that it was snapped up by my lovely cousin who desired a ring which was modern and classic and I think the square Diamonds perfectly frame the 10mm round (4.59ct) Spinel to create such a ring.'),
  array('Sapphire and Diamond Ring','This client was sent to me on a three line whip by his Auntie, an existing customer and he knew he wanted to propose with a ring and that it should be traditional, other than that he was totally open to ideas.  The final choice is the most beautiful 2.19ct octagonal Sapphire set surrounded xx pts of diamonds set in Platinum.'),
  array('Emerald cut Diamond and Sapphire ring','A very stylish Antique Deco style ring which is much worn and loved….Look after your jewels and check your claws…the last time this ring was with me the centre diamond had popped out onto the table at a restaurant! Luckily it was retrieved and set back in its place.'),
  array('Scissor Cut Aquamarine and Diamond Ring',' A gorgeous 40th birthday gift from my client\'s parents, after considering many types of coloured gems they selected an amazing 4.74cts scissor cut Aquamarine and using .50pts of diamonds on the shoulders chose a timeless art deco style.'),
  array('Diamond and Sapphire Ring','All my rings are hand made, however this one is a work of art. My client brought me a hugely sentimental and beautiful old cut 2 ct Diamond which she wanted to be set in a modern but timeless design. By surrounding the Diamond with two rows of bespoke cut perfectly matched blue baguette Sapphire\'s we managed to create a cocktail ring which is jaw dropping but still delicate enough to be extremely comfortable to wear.'),
  array('Ruby and Diamond Ring','My brief was to make a Ruby cocktail ring. My client had the brilliant cut diamonds and I sourced a selection of Rubies to choose from. This one weighs 3.35cts and is the true red of a good South East Asian ruby. We set the ring in Platinum with Baguettes Diamonds to give the ring a more contemporary feel, an important piece for a serious jewellery collector.'),
  array('Emerald Ring with Diamond shoulders','Square cut Colombian Emerald bezel set in 24ct gold with pave set diamond shoulders in 18ct yellow gold.'),
  array('Untreated Yellow Sapphire Ring','I loved helping Alyson and Simon to create their perfect engagement ring, they had a very strong design aesthetic and I encouraged them to primarily focus on choosing the perfect stone. We considered yellow and blue Diamonds, all colours of Sapphires and Spinels, settling on the most amazing 11.26ct natural french lemon Sapphire (with a Gem-A lab report) set in a really simple 18ct yellow gold setting. '),
  array('Aquamarine and Hessonite Garnet Ring','A strikingly simple design comprising a square 7.92ct Aquamarine set with the perfect pale orange tone of 6.85cts Hessonite Garnets to complement the 18ct white and rose gold setting'),
  array('Australian Sapphire and Tsvorite Garnet ring','A dark blue Australian Sapphire (12.30cts) held in rose gold with a band of the most vivid green baguette cut Tsavorite Garnets, the colour combination is superb and this was one ring I was tempted to keep!'),
  array('Star Cabochon Ruby Ring','This is a seriously large star Ruby ring, weighing in at approx 70cts....the optical phenomenon called asterism creates a star in sunlight or any form of direct light adding to the fun of the stone. I have supplied other clients with smaller versions….'),
  array('Untreated Yellow Sapphire and Champagne Diamond Ring','This client met a spiritual man in India who advised her to wear a Sapphire for her health...she popped in for a coffee, immediately fell in love with this octagonal natural french lemon sapphire weighing 5.06cts. We designed a ring using soft champagne diamonds in 18ct rose gold...She swears it keeps her calm!'),
  array('Amethyst Cocktail Ring','A special wedding anniversary gave my client the opportunity to own a gorgeous 8.73ct Amethyst cocktail ring, the unique chequerboard cut on the stone and the 18ct rose gold setting make this ring really special.'),
  array('Peridot and Diamond Ring','Years of yearning for the perfect green Peridot ring, lead to an extensive search for the right one! Once we found the 8.5ct oval cushion cut stone all we did was place a few diamonds on the shoulders and let the beautiful stone speak for itself.'),
  array('Hessonite Garnet ring','This stunning oval 7.90ct Hessonite Garnet was chosen by a client for her birthday, she wanted a really simple smooth organic style which would really enhance the gorgeous rich colour of the stone. It was just a bonus that garnet is her birthstone…'),

  array('Emerald and Diamond Cluster style Ring','An existing client recommended a friend of hers who had a negative experience of remodelling some jewellery in the past, therefore we took the process very slowly. Her original ring was in a wiry 70\'s setting and she had not worn it for a long time. I think the photo shows how amazing the ring looks now and I am delighted to say she immediately asked me to work on the design for a pendant using stones from two of her rings.'),
  array('Pink Sapphire and Watermelon Tourmaline ring','The brief was \'make me a big funky lunch ring\'. We did by designing the unheard of combination of a bezel setting a 5ct pink sapphire in 18ct rose gold with two rough cut slices of Watermelon Tourmaline showing their concentric rings of pink and green which perfectly match the sapphires\' gorgeous colour.'),
  array('Octagonal Green Sapphire with Green Sapphire shoulders','All clients are individual, however this Aussie only liked the colour copper and wore absolutely no jewellery at all, ever! However when proposed to it all had to change...and if you could see this ring on her finger you would know there could be no other! A dark green Octagonal 4.11 ct Sapphire supported by two light green oval cut Sapphires weighing 4.86cts in gorgeous 18ct Rose Gold. Totally a one off.'),

  array('Colombian Emerald with trillion cut diamonds','A bright green .75ct Emerald with triangular diamond shoulders in a rub over setting. This style of setting is very good for protecting the Emerald.'),
  array('Sapphire and Diamond Band ring','A special ring made with blue sapphires and diamonds in 18ct yellow gold to remember a promise made by my friend to her mother. Her mother wanted to know what she was going to spend a gift of some money on and she said a ring made with blue stones as they are your favourite colour.')
