Sassalina was born from a life-long passion for jewellery and gems.  As a teenager my parents encouraged me to design jewellery incorporating inherited gems and I still wear these pieces today. I believe if the bespoke design perfectly suits the style of the wearer the jewellery will be timeless and the memories held within the piece very powerful.  
</p>
<p>After having my three children, I was determined to have a second career based on my passion. I started by attending holiday courses at Central St Martin’s in jewellery making.   Knowledge of making is essential to design, however quite quickly I knew I wanted to become a Gemmologist.  In 2008 I returned to full time study and become a Fellow of the Gemological Association of Great Britain.  I have also attended GIA courses in jewellery drawing. I have been designing for myself since 1983 and for clients since 2006.
