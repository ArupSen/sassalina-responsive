<h4>Francesca G Testimonial</h4>
<p>“When I met with Sarah I had a clear idea of what I wanted to commission, a pair of earrings that could  be worn everyday and to be made from pale/white stones. However I did not want to use pearls or diamonds, as I really wanted them to be organic and unusual in design.</p>
<p>Sarah suggested using some semi precious gems that I had never heard of, very unusual and exactly what I wanted. She also held my hand throughout the design process ensuring I was happy with every detail.  I am delighted with the result and use the earrings even more than I expected!”</p>
